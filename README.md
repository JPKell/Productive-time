# Productive timer
A tkinter based productivity timer which allows you to chain together multiple timers one after another. One common application of this is as a pomodoro timer. Also perfect for frozen fries. 

# Getting started
## Dependencies 
- Python > 3.8
That's it, the rest is pure Python.

## Executing the program
This is run from the command line with
`python main.py` 

You can also build with something like pyinstaller if you want a clickable executable

## MuteMe integration
MuteMe is a great device for when you are on a video chat. But for all those other times it's not doing much. Put it to use as a visual aid for your timers and let people know you're in a focused mode.

## Features
This was created for personal use and development is in bursts. There are things I would like to add. In no particular order:

- Optional background color rather than time color for timers
- Better reports
  - Filters 
  - Primary column date or category 
  - Nesting chained timers in report
  - remove id columns from csv
- File prompt on linux does not play well with dark theme
