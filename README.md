# eMetuM 

The [MuteMe](http://muteme.com) is a good product that serves a purpose. For some, controlling the mute of their micriphone in web meetings and displaying your mute status with lights is not that benefitial. For those people *(who use Linux)* I wrote eMetuM. It's a very simple Pomodoro timer, and light controller.  

The pomodoro timer will glow red when working and green while on break. 

There are additional controls which let you set the device to any of the colors or lighting modes (dim, not dim, slow pulse, or fast pulse), plus a *NEW* strobe mode. 

If you have installed the software from MuteMe you're already set to go. Otherwise you will need to `sudo ./create_rules.sh` to create the rules to let the app access the device file .

Enjoy.
