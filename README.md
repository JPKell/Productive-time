# Productive timer
A tkinter based productivity timer which allows you to chain together multiple timers one after another. One common application of this is as a pomodoro timer. Also perfect for frozen fries. 

## MuteMe integration
MuteMe is a great device for when you are on a video chat. But for all those other times it's not doing much. Put it to use as a visual aid for your timers and let people know you're in a focused mode.
